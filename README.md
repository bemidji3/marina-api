# OVERVIEW

You are managing a marina website. The website displays a table of 20 spots a boat can be. From the website, a user should be able to

- Add a boat
- Move a boat to a different spot in the marina
- Remove a boat

A boat has three attributes

- Name
- Length
- Color

The website is built in React and makes API calls to the Rails server to update the database and retrieve the current marina.

What we care about:

- Getting a working solution
- Adding some comments
- Don't spend more than 4 hours on it ... if it takes any longer just add in a README what you would add if you had more time.

What we don't care about

- Styling .. don't spend too much time making it look good.
